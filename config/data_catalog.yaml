    notes: |
      ESGF provides DAMIP hist-nat and ALL/SSP data. We query by model,
      experiment, table, and variable, then pick OPeNDAP access URLs when
      available to avoid downloading full files. Grid labels are preferred in
      the order listed.

reanalysis:

    description: "20CRv3 Tmax; provides historical context for tx01 and trend maps."
    example_odata: "https://psl.noaa.gov/thredds/dodsC/20CRv3/derived/prmsl.ctl"  # placeholder endpoint for structure; replace with Tmax daily path when available.
    notes: "Endpoint kept configurable; code treats any OpenDAP/THREDDS URL exposing daily tasmax."

stations:
  provider: "meteostat"
  notes: |
    Meteostat offers free daily station data without API keys. Station lookups
    are by ID (preferred) or nearest lat/lon match from config/sites.yaml. Doha
    (QAT) is pre-wired with station 41170.
